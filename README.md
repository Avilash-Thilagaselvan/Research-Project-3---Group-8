# Research-Project-3---Group-8
This Repository is For Partial Completion of Research Project 3 (Sustainable Energy in Challenging Environments)

This notebook currently uses the SciPy, NumPy, Pandas DataFrame, and PyPlot libraries. 

The dataset used was specific to Tadoussac, Quebec, which is the group's assigned location. 

Phase 1 of the Jupyter Notebook utilized the Wind and Water Energy types, as they were assigned to the group. This phase characterized the energy type by summarizing a Tadoussac wind speed dataset and using numerical integration to an energy-power series. This was later used to create a first-pass model plotting the energy-power series. 

Phase 2 of the Notebook only used the Wind Energy type, as the group believed that this was the most useful and efficient energy generation method for Tadoussac. This phase creates a dynamic model via the usage of both discrete-time bookkeeping as well as an continous-time ordered differential equation. By using both equations, the accuracy of the model can be tested and verified to hold for Tadoussac. In addition, Phase 2 created a toy demand profile that can describe consumption data for Tadoussac, helping scientists and policy-makers plan out the grid and energy generation types necessary for the community.
